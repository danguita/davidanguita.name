## Deploy on GitHub Pages

My `/build` dir is linked to [another GitHub repo](https://github.com/danguita/danguita.github.com) which is configured as GitHub Page.

After each build, I move into `/build` and commit all changes. GitHub Pages does the rest.

## License

Feel free to use any of files. If you do use them, a link back to my personal webpage would be appreciated, but is not required.
