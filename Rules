# A few helpful tips about the Rules file:
#
# * The order of rules is important: for each item, only the first matching
#   rule is applied.
#
# * Item identifiers start and end with a slash (e.g. "/about/" for the file
#   "content/about.html"). To select all children, grandchildren, ... of an
#   item, use the pattern "/about/*/"; "/about/*" will also select the parent,
#   because "*" matches zero or more characters.

# compilation
compile '/assets/*/' do
  # nothing
end

compile '*' do
  filter :erb
  layout 'default'
end

# routing
route '/assets/*/' do
  if !['scss', 'coffee'].include?(item[:extension])
    item.identifier[7..-2] + '.' + item[:extension]
  end
end

route '*' do
  item.identifier + 'index.html'
end

# layouts
layout '*', :erb
