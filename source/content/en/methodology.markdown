# Work methodology

### Complete dedication and project tracking

I do **iterative development**, allowing us to observe the product
evolution and to have a minimal and ready for production version
in a short time.

My tracking cycles (meeting, presentation or feedback request) are
generally weekly, so we could plan the next development cycles this
often.

Software development processes are living things. An immovable
development strategy usually doesn't match the real world. The product
**quality** must be the highest aim and it usually depends on the team
(providers and clients) adaptability.

### Maintainability

Looking for the product quality and its **maintainability**, I always
apply **TDD** (Test Driven Development). This development process can give
us a good practical documentation and ensures satisfying all features.
