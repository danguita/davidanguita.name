# What I'm doing now

👋 Inspired by [José Ferrer](https://twitter.com/joseferrer)'s page, which was in turn inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff), here's what I'm currently doing:

* Doing consulting for my friends at [Jobandtalent](https://www.jobandtalent.com).
* Freelancing mostly Ruby, Elixir and React projects.
* _Bootstrapping_ a couple of side projects.
* [Playing videogames](/plays) 🎮️
* Working out and running as much as I can.
* Last but not least, traveling with [my lovely wife](https://www.instagram.com/soryflins/).

*Last updated: March 3, 2019.*
