# What I'm doing now

üëã Inspired by [Jos√© Ferrer](https://twitter.com/joseferrer)'s idea, here's what I'm currently doing:

* Freelancing in Ruby and Elixir based products, with focus on well-crafted code and product development.
* Bootstrapping on a couple of *kind of projects* with friends.
* Learning new things and improving my development skills, as always.
* Working out and running as much as I can üí™
* Attending and speaking at tech events. I love to meet new and *old* friends from the industry to catch-up and share thoughts.
* Playing videogames! These days, you can find me playing [Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/dark-souls-ii-scholar-of-the-first-sin) (PS4), [Titanfall 2](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/titanfall-2) (PS4), [Gravity Rush Remastered](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/gravity-rush-remastered) (PS4) and [Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate](http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/monster-hunter-4-ultimate) (3DS). BTW, this is my PSN ID: *DaveBigBoss* ‚ù§Ô∏è üéÆ
* I've also been trying to read more: At the time of writing this, [Ashlee Vance's Elon Musk biography](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233/) is in my backpack, and [Run or Die](https://www.amazon.com/Run-Die-Kilian-Jornet/dp/1937715094/) is right on my desk. Also, I'm rereading [this edition of Watchmen](https://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-Deluxe-Alan-Moore/dp/1401238963/).
* Last but not least, traveling with my [lovely wife](https://www.instagram.com/soryflins/).
