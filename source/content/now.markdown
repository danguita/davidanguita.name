# What I'm doing now

ðŸ‘‹ Inspired by [JosÃ© Ferrer](https://twitter.com/joseferrer)'s idea, here's what I'm currently doing:

* Freelancing in Ruby and Elixir based products, with focus on well-crafted code and product development.
* Bootstrapping on a couple of *kind of projects* with friends.
* Learning new things and improving my development skills, as always.
* Working out and running as much as I can ðŸ’ª
* Attending and speaking at tech events. I love to meet new and *old* friends from the industry to catch-up and share thoughts.
* [Playing videogames](/play), as always!
* I've also been trying to read more: At the time of writing this, [Ashlee Vance's Elon Musk biography](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233/) is in my backpack, and [Run or Die](https://www.amazon.com/Run-Die-Kilian-Jornet/dp/1937715094/) is right on my desk. Also, I'm rereading [this edition of Watchmen](https://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-Deluxe-Alan-Moore/dp/1401238963/).
* Last but not least, traveling with my [lovely wife](https://www.instagram.com/soryflins/).
