# What I'm doing now

👋 Inspired by José Ferrer's [post](http://moviendo.me/now/), here's what I'm currently doing:

* Freelancing in Ruby and Elixir based products, with focus on well-crafted code and system architecture.
* Taking some time to push my own projects forward 🚀
* Learning new things and improving my development skills, and therefore my services. I'm currently focused on Elixir, Docker, Kubernetes, Elm and React.
* Helping friends with their product vision and software development stuff.
* Playing videogames! These days, you can find me playing Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (PS4), Titanfall 2 (PS4), The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (PC) and Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate (3DS). BTW, this is my PSN ID: *DaveBigBoss* ❤️ 🎮
* Weightlifting and running as much as I can, although the weather is not being very cooperative lately here in Spain ❄️
* [Organizing](http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/ciudadrealrb/) and attending tech events.
* Traveling with my [lovely wife](https://www.instagram.com/soryflins/).
