# What I'm doing now

ðŸ‘‹ Inspired by [JosÃ© Ferrer](https://twitter.com/joseferrer)'s page, which in turn was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/)' [one](https://sivers.org/nowff), here's what I'm currently doing:

* Doing consulting for my friends at [Jobandtalent](https://www.jobandtalent.com)
* Freelancing on some products using Ruby and Elixir technologies
* Bootstrapping on a couple of *kind of projects* with friends (*That's top secret*)
* Working out and running as much as I can ðŸ’ª
* [Playing videogames](/play)
* I've also been trying to read more: At the time of writing this, [Ashlee Vance's Elon Musk biography](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233/) is in my backpack, and [Run or Die](https://www.amazon.com/Run-Die-Kilian-Jornet/dp/1937715094/) is right on my desk. Also, I'm rereading [this edition of Watchmen](https://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-Deluxe-Alan-Moore/dp/1401238963/).
* Last but not least, traveling with my [lovely wife](https://www.instagram.com/soryflins/).
