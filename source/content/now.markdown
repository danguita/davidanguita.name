# What I'm doing now

Inspired by José Ferrer's [post](http://moviendo.me/now/), here's what I'm currently working on:

* Freelancing in cool Ruby based products, with focus on well-crafted code and system architecture.
* Helping friends with their product vision and software development stuff.
* Learning new technologies that are improving my development skills, and therefore my services. I'm currently focused on Docker, Elixir, Phoenix and React.
* Working on a couple of pet projects that I'd love to have publicly available very soon.
* [Organizing](http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/ciudadrealrb/) and attending tech events.
* Playing videogames. In the last few weeks I've been playing Bloodborne (PS4), Dark Souls (Xbox 360) and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds (3DS) ❤️ 🎮
* Weightlifting and running as much as I can. It's being a great season to me to get fit 💪
* Traveling with my [lovely wife](https://www.instagram.com/soryflins/).
