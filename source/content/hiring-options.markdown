# Collaboration options

## By project

In this modality, we check the project, then we get a list of requirements and a
development plan. After that, we can estimate the product value, the cost of
development, and the production deployment timing.

The production deployment is rarely the end, so the product will be ready to get
any kind of updates or improvements over time.

## By fixed period

This collaboration option might be interesting for the review, improvement, or
feature development for already started projects. My involvement in this case is
stricter, so the agreed tasks will be developed in hourly units and predefined
rates.
