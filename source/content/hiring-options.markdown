# Hiring options

## By project

We check the project, then we get a list of features and a development
plan. After that we can estimate the product value, cost of development and
production deployment timing.

The production deployment **is not the end**, so the product will
be ready to get any kind of updates or improvements.

## By weeks

This hiring option might be interesting for review, improvement or
feature development for already started projects. My involvement in this
case is stricter so the agreed tasks will be developed in weekly
units and predefined rates.

The minimum hiring period is two weeks.
