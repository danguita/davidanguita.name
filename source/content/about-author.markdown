I'm an independent software consultant with over 15 years of experience working
remotely with companies all around the world, specializing in **Ruby on Rails**
and **Node.js** back-ends.

My focus is on **software architecture**, meaning designing systems for
maintainability, reliability, and scale. I've also been **leading engineering
teams** effectively, ensuring an environment where people can do their best
work.

Outside of work, you can find me working out, traveling, and playing video
games.

While I don't [tweet](https://twitter.com/danguita) very often, I do
[write code](https://github.com/danguita) almost every day.
