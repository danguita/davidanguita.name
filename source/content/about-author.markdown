Hi! I'm an independent software developer with +10 years of professional experience, currently focused on the *Ruby*, *Elixir* and *JavaScript* ecosystems.

One of my favourite parts of this job is being able to sit in my chair spinning around, thinking about stuff. I love to keep learning and facing new challenges every day.

When I'm not working, you can find me playing video games, running, traveling, or organizing and attending tech events. Here's what [I'm doing now](/now).

I also [tweet](https://twitter.com/danguita) and [push code](https://github.com/danguita) quite often, and [show off pictures](https://www.instagram.com/danguita) from time to time.
