Hi! I'm an independent software consultant with 15+ years of experience,
specializing in full-stack web development, software architecture, and
managing engineering teams.

Outside of work, you can find me working out, traveling, and playing
video games.

While I don't [tweet](https://twitter.com/danguita) very often, I do
[write code](https://github.com/danguita) almost every day.
