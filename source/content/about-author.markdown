Hi! I'm an independent software engineer with +13 years of professional experience, currently focused on software architecture, highly performant systems, and management of engineering teams.

When I'm not working, you can find me playing video games, working out, reading, or traveling around the world.

I don't [tweet](https://twitter.com/danguita) very often, but I do [write code](https://github.com/danguita) almost every day.
