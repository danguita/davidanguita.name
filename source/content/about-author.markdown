Hi! I'm an independent software developer with +10 years of professional experience, currently focused on the *Ruby*, *Rails*, *Elixir* and *JavaScript* ecosystems.

One of my favourite parts of this job is being able to sit in my chair spinning around, thinking about stuff. I love to keep learning and facing new challenges every day.

When I'm not working, you can find me playing video games, working out, reading, or traveling around the world.

I don't [tweet](https://twitter.com/danguita) very often, but I do [write code](https://github.com/danguita) almost every day.
