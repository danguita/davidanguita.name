# About

This is the static output of my tiny [personal website](http://davidanguita.name), that's how I did it:

* Dirty work done by [nanoc framework](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/): It transforms the framework content into static files.
* Stylesheets managed by [Compass framework](http://compass-style.org/).
* JavaScript written in [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) language.
